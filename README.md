# chaotic-attractors

Visualize and experiment with Chaos Equations and Strange Attractors.

This repo consists of a fork of [this repository](https://github.com/orfeasliossatos/Coding-Projects) which was tweaked and ported to Linux.

[Video demonstration](https://youtu.be/idpOunnpKTo?si=GenFkDGUzg6Co1Zy) (from the [original creator](https://github.com/orfeasliossatos))

## Requirements

This project uses SFML. You may easily find SFML and SFML-devel in your package manager of choice or [build it yourself](https://github.com/SFML/SFML). The original project used version 2.5.1 of SFML but newer should suffice.

## Usage

To compile and execute the program:

```bash
./run.sh
```

### Controls

Intuitive "Minecraft" controls. "H" and "h" act the same.

> W/A/S/D for moving in the plane
>
> Space/Shift to move up and down
>
> Up/Down/Left/Right to turn the camera

Or as [AnonymoZ](https://github.com/AnonymoZ) put it:

> Move to the next attractor with “H” and to the previous attractor with “G”.
>
> Press “Page Up” and “Page Down” now to control the speed of the motion.
>
> Use the Arrow Keys, “W, A, S, D” and also “LShift and Space” to move the camera.
>
> The Arrow Keys will only tilt the camera angle, while “LShift”, “Space”, “A” and “D” move “↑”, “↓”, “←”, “→” respectively.
>
> And finally “W” and “S” zoom in and out of the canvas.
>
> Press “Esc” to exit the program.
>
> Change to fullscreen or not with “F”.
