# chaotic-attractors

Visualize and experiment with Chaos Equations and Strange Attractors.

This repo consists of a fork of [this repository](https://github.com/orfeasliossatos/Coding-Projects) which was tweaked and ported to Linux.

## Requirements

This project uses SFML. You may easily find SFML and SFML-devel in your package manager of choice or [build it yourself](https://github.com/SFML/SFML). The original project used version 2.5.1 of SFML but newer should suffice.

## Usage

Run `./run.sh` to compile and execute the program.

### Controls

H to switch to the next attractor

W/A/S/D for moving in the plane

Space/Shift to move up and down

Up/Down/Left/Right to turn the camera

These will feel familiar to Minecraft players ;)

### Todo:

Pick a font that every distro ships.
