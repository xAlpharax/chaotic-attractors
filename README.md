# chaotic-attractors
Fork of https://github.com/orfeasliossatos/Coding-Projects tweaked and ported to Linux.

The only requirement needed is SFML, you should be able to grab it from your package manager.
This project uses SFML 2.5.1

Run ./run.sh to compile and execute the program.

Controls :
H to switch to the next attractor

W/A/S/D for moving in the plane

Space/Shift to move up and down

Up/Down/Left/Right to turn the camera

These will feel familiar to Minecraft players ;)
